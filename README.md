FlashLoan(AAVE)

Here are the Binance exchanges: 
    PancakeSwap,
    Uniswap, 
    MDEX


Please check these.

- AAVE don't support flashloan with binance smart chain.
  So flashLoan execute works with polygon only.
- We have some wrong dex list as like as below.
    Binance DEX : It was dex fo BNB chain not binance smart chain.
    1 Inch: It is aggregator.so it use another dex's pool mainnly as like as i said.
    MEXC : It is CEX, not DEX.

    So we can do with
    . uniswap
    . pancakeswap
    . MDEX

I am deploying smart contracts to BSC chain.
I will deliver completed works today with BSC also.
